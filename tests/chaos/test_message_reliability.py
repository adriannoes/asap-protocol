"""Chaos engineering tests for message reliability simulation.

This module tests the resilience of the ASAP client when facing message
delivery issues. It simulates:
- Message loss (requests that never get responses)
- Message duplication (same message received multiple times)
- Out-of-order message delivery
- Partial message corruption

These tests verify that:
1. The client properly handles missing responses with timeout/retry
2. Duplicate messages are handled gracefully (idempotency)
3. The system maintains consistency under unreliable delivery
4. Error messages are clear and actionable
