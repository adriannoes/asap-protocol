"""MCP Auth Bridge: ASAP auth on native ``MCPServer`` ``tools/call``.

MCP auth belongs inside the MCP package (``asap.mcp.auth``), next to
:mod:`asap.mcp.protocol` and :mod:`asap.mcp.server`, rather than under the
OpenAPI-centric ``asap.adapters`` namespace. The legacy ``asap.adapters.mcp``
import path is preserved as a thin deprecation shim so existing callers keep
working during the deprecation window.

Public surface (unchanged): ``protect_server``, ``MCPAuthConfig``,
``ProtectedMCPServer``, ``resolve_jwt_extractor``.

Example:
    >>> from asap.mcp.auth import MCPAuthConfig, protect_server
    >>> protected = protect_server(server, config)
