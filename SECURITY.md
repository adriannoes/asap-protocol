## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ASAP Protocol seriously. If you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT report it publicly.

### How to Report

We use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting**. If you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately using the "Report a vulnerability" button in the **Security** tab of this repository.

Direct link: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/adriannoes/asap-protocol/security/advisories/new)

If for some reason you cannot use the GitHub reporting tool, please open an issue asking for a private communication channel without disclosing the vulnerability details.

### Information to Include

Please include as much information as possible to help us reproduce and validate the issue:

-   **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability.
-   **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (a Proof of Concept script is highly appreciated).
-   **Environment**:
    -   Library version (e.g., 0.1.0)
    -   Python version (e.g., 3.13)
    -   Operating system
-   **Impact**: How this vulnerability could be exploited and what the potential impact is.
-   **Logs/Output**: Any relevant error messages or logs.

### What Happens Next

1.  **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours via the GitHub advisory discussion.
2.  **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and collaborate with you in the private advisory to confirm the vulnerability.
3.  **Resolution**: We will work on a fix. GitHub allows us to create a private fork to develop the fix and collaborate securely.
4.  **Release**: Once the fix is ready and verified, we will merge it, release a new version of the package, and publish a Security Advisory (CVE) crediting you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep the ASAP Protocol secure!
