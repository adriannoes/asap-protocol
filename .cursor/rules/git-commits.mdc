# Git Conventional Commits

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to generate commit messages.

## Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types
- **feat**: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer).
- **fix**: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer).
- **docs**: Documentation only changes.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.

## Rules
1. **Breaking Changes**: Must be indicated by a `!` after the type/scope OR by `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Types must be lowercase (except `BREAKING CHANGE` in footers).
3. **Description**: Short, imperative summary of the change.
4. **Body**: Longer description of "what" and "why" (not "how").
5. **Footers**: Used for tracking issues (e.g., `Refs: #123`) or breaking changes.
