# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone. We expect everyone to treat others with respect and kindness.

## The Rules: Be a Good Human (or AI agent)

1.  **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is fine, disrespect is not.
2.  **Be Inclusive**: We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities.
3.  **Be Constructive**: Criticism should be helpful and actionable, not personal.
4.  **No Harassment**: Any form of harassment or discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Enforcement

If you see behavior that violates these rules, please report it to the maintainers (e.g., via private email or GitHub issue if appropriate). Violators may be warned or banned from the project at the maintainers' discretion.

Basically: **Don't be a jerk.** :)
